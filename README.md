A **Discord bot** that lets you search, queue, and manage movie torrents via qBittorrent directly from Discord slash commands. It was founded for the purpose to allow me and my friends to quickly add our entertainment needs to my plex server remotely.

Integration:

- **YTS API**: search for torrents
- **qBittorrent-nox WebUI**: queue and manage torrents
- **Bun**: fast runtime for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Docker**: easy deployment, no manual setup

cd dc-torrent
```

  - `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token

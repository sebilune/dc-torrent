- **qBittorrent-nox** ‚Äì queue and manage torrents
- **Bun** ‚Äì fast runtime for JavaScript/TypeScript

## Requirements

You‚Äôll need the following installed on your Linux machine:

### qBittorrent-nox

qBittorrent‚Äôs headless version that runs in the background.

#### Ubuntu/Debian

Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qbittorrent-nox
```

Start it with:

```bash
qbittorrent-nox
```

By default, it exposes a web UI at `http://localhost:8080`. You'll need to configure the web UI login credentials and optionally change the save path (download directory) as by default it's set to `/home/yourusername/Downloads`.

### Bun

[Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

Install via the official script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

<p></p>

If after installing through the official script you see errors like:

```bash
bun: command not found
```

you likely need to add Bun‚Äôs installation path to your shell‚Äôs environment. Bun installs by default to `$HOME/.bun`.

To make sure it‚Äôs available in your terminal, you must add some lines to your shell configuration (by default `.bashrc` on Linux).

**1. Open your `.bashrc` file**

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

**2. Add these lines to the bottom:**

```bash
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

**3. Save and exit (in nano, press `Ctrl+O` then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`).**

**4. Reload your shell:**

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Once done, run:

```bash
bun --version
```

‚úÖ If you see a version number, you‚Äôre all set.

Or install with [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux):

```bash
brew install bun
```

<summary><strong>Errors? Open me</strong></summary>

<p></p>

If this is your **first time installing Homebrew** on Linux, after running the install script,  
you need to add the following to your shell configuration so `brew` works properly:

```bash
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

To make sure it‚Äôs available in your terminal, you must add some lines to your shell configuration (by default `.bashrc` on Linux).

**1. Open your `.bashrc` file**

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

**2. Add this line to the bottom:**

```bash
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

**3. Save and exit (in nano, press `Ctrl+O` then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`).**

**4. Reload your shell:**

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Once done, run:

```bash
brew --version
```

‚úÖ If you see a version number, you‚Äôre all set.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get started:

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebilune/dc-torrent.git
cd dc-torrent
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash

```

**3. Configure the bot**

The configuration file can be found in the source directory (dc-torrent), open `config.json` in your preffered text editor and fill in the following:

- `qbittorrent_url`: Usually `http://localhost:8080/`
- `qbittorrent_username` and `qbittorrent_password`: Your Web UI login. Defaults are included.
- `role_id` (optional): Only allow users with this server role to run commands

You can create and configure your bot token in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

‚ö† **Important:** Make sure your bot has all three **Privileged Gateway Intents** enabled.  
You can turn these on in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) under **Bot ‚Üí Privileged Gateway Intents**.

- `Presence Intent`: Required for your bot to receive Presence Update events.
- `Server Members Intent`: Required for your bot to receive events listed under GUILD_MEMBERS.
- `Message Content Intent`: Required for your bot to receive message content in most messages.

**4. Run the bot:**

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

On startup, it will register slash commands and begin listening for interactions.
